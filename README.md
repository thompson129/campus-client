# Client Side (Developer Guide) :open_book:

## Project Initialization

Open the root project folder in your favorite terminal and do the following:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/KMUTT-CampusLink/campus-client.git
> cd campus-client
> cp .env.example .env.local
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

## Folder Structure :file_folder:

We will use a **modular** or **feature-based** folder structure in this project. Each group focuses only on two root folders, `public` folder and `/src/modules` folder. Please follow the steps below to create an organized structure for your group:

1. Create a folder under the `public` folder to store static assets, such as images, SVGs, and icons. Its name, which should resemble to your feature name, must consist of only `lowercase letters` and `hyphens`. For example, registration, building-security, auto-attendance
2. Under `/src/modules`, you will see many folders named after each feature. Choose your group folder, and create the following folders in it:
   - components (react components for each sub feature)
   - hooks (for custom react hooks if you need them)
   - pages
   - services (for data fetching)
   - styles (in case you need plain css, but be it `the last resort`)

If you feel lost, please see the image below:<br><br>

## Git branching & Pull request

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please read very carefully as this part is so important.

There will be two main branches that will live forever, namely `main` and `develop` branches. Then, we will have two categories of short-term branches called `feature` and `bugfix`. You are only allowed to create pull requests to merge into the `develop` branch. If you are uncertain about `branching & pull requests`, please contact me directly on `Discord`. Naming conventions are given below:

1.  For `feature` branches: `g[01-13]-feat/[student-ID-last-two-digits]/sub-feature-name`
2.  For `bugfix` branches: `g[01-13]-bugfix/[student-ID-last-two-digits]/bug-name`

    ```py
    // Examples:

    g05-feat/30/question-shuffle
    g10-feat/03/qr-scanner

    g05-bugfix/25/validation-on-server
    g10-bugfix/10/qr-creation-fixed

    ```

> [!TIP]
> Just to make your life and our lives easier, you should make yourself familiar with `pull requests`. I would recommend you to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Q1kHG842HoI?si=wJYbuEGgB20Aol4F) at least one. You can also contact me directly on `Discord`.

## Formatting your code

We have included `.vscode` folder in the repo, and in which is a `settings.json` file. Please make sure that `.vscode` folder is in your `root directory` and add the formatter extensions if you have not installed them yet.

- prettier
- svg
- prisma
- tailwind css intellisense

## Tech Stack :moyai:

This tech stack is the bare minimum, so depending on features you will develop, you will need others as well.

- react
- react-router-dom
- react-hook-form
- zod
- react-query
- axios
- tailwind css

> [!TIP]
> To speed up your frontend development, I recommend to use pre-created components from [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) library. As this library is implemented using tailwind CSS, you can utilize their compatibility.
